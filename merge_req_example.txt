Context:

an advocate creates an account in hub A
the same advocate tries to create an account in hub B with a different
password (the advocate is not authenticated in hub A, so the application
can't confirm the identity)

System behavior:

Hub prevents the user to create the account in hub B because the
password does not match

Bug:

We are returning the message to the user, however we are creating a
contact without a persisted user.

Impact:

A non-joined contact is created and visible in the Invite List
improperly

Solution:

Check if the user is not persisted and the email is already taken. If
this happens, we should return early, before the contact creation.
